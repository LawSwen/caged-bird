Child mortality remains one of the major challenges facing global health.
UNICEF estimated that almost half of child mortality happens during the first 
five months of birth attributing this to premature birth and complications during labor. 
Most of these deaths occur in places that are often without the needed resources to ensure early 
prognosis and treatments of complications that may arise during pregnancy.  For example, 
in 2023, UNICEF reported that 1 in 15 children died in sub-Saharan Africa. 
Considering these challenges, designing cost effective way to monitor and treat early pregnancy complications remains 
an active area for research. This project proposes a Cardiotocograms (CTG) and the deployment of a machine learning model as 
a cost effective and simple way to examine fetal health, enabling health practitioners,
midwives and doctors take immediate actions to address complications and distress that may occur during pregnancy and labor.
